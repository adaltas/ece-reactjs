# Your project:

You create a simple blog website. On the home page you have a list of articles (name, author, date of publishing). By clicking on the article name you open an article page (name, author, date of publishing, article text with a different markup).

## Using the code from the previous exercises, do:

1. Create minimum 2 articles in markdown files with the info like: name, author, date of publishing, article text using different markup (paragraphs, links, images, lists). 

*Hint: Copy and paste the project folder from the module 3 (don't forget to give a name to your new project).*

2. On the Home page create a list of articles (displaying info like name, author, date of publishing). By clicking on the name you are redirected to the article page.

*Hint: The list is a react component, the row of the list is a child react component. Use GraphQL for querying data from markdown files.*

3. On the article page below the text of the article create a component for commenting it. It should have minimum 2 fields (comment field <textarea>, name field <input>) and the button for submitting data. After clicking the Submit button it displays a new comment below.

*Hint: You need to create a React component and import it to the file `templates/page.js`* 

## Bonus tasks:

1. Add short article announce to the list on the home page
2. Add a date of comment to the component of commenting
3. Make your website unique (website name, colors, fonts, texts on the home page and in the footer...)
4. Customise the page 404
